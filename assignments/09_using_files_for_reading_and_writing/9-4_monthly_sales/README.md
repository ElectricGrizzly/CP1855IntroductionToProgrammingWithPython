# Project 9-4: Monthly Sales
Create a program that reads the sales for 12 months from a file and calculates the total yearly sales as well as the average monthly sales. In addition, this program should let the user edit the sales for any month.

## Specifications
- For the edit command, display an error message if the user doesnâ€™t enter a valid three-letter abbreviation for the month.
- When the user edits the sales amount for a month, the data should be saved to the CSV file immediately. That way, no data is lost, even if the program crashes later.
- Round the results of the monthly average to a maximum of 2 decimal digits.
