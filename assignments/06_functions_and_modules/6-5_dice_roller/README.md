# Project 6-5: Dice Roller
Create a program that uses a function to simulate the roll of a dice.
## Console
```
Dice Roller

Roll the dice? (y/n): y

Die 1: 3
Die 2: 6
Total: 9

Roll again? (y/n): y

Die 1: 1
Die 2: 1
Total: 2
Snake eyes!

Roll again? (y/n): y

Die 1: 6
Die 2: 6
Total: 12
Boxcars!

Roll again? (y/n): n
```
## Specifications
- The program should roll two six-sided dice.
- Store the code that rolls a single die in a function.
- Store the code that gets input and displays output in the main function. Whenever itâ€™s helpful, use helper functions to split this code into other functions.
- The program should display a special message for two ones (snake eyes) and two sixes (boxcars).
