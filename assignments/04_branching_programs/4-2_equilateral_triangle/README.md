# Project 4-2: Equilateral Triangle
Create a program that determines if a triangle is an equilateral triangle â€“ a triangle whose sides are the same length.
## Console
```
Enter the first side: 25
Enter the second side: 30
Enter the third side:: 15
The triangle is not equilateral.
```
## Specifications
- Get user input for each side
- Assume that the user will enter valid integers for the sides.
- The program should output if the triangle is or is not an equilateral triangle.
