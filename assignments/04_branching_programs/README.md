### Console
```
Letter Grade Converter

Enter numerical grade: 90
Letter grade: A

Continue? (y/n): y

Enter numerical grade: 88
Letter grade: A

Continue? (y/n): y

Enter numerical grade: 80
Letter grade: B

Continue? (y/n): y

Enter numerical grade: 67
Letter grade: C

Continue? (y/n): y

Enter numerical grade: 59
Letter grade: F

Continue? (y/n): n

Bye!
```
### Specifications
- The grading criteria is as follows: A 88-100 B 80-87 C 67-79 D 60-66 F <60
- Assume that the user will enter valid integers for the grades.
- The program should continue only if the user enters “y” or “Y” to continue.
