## Specifications
- The sales tax rate should be 6% of the total.
- Store the sales tax rate in a module. This module should also contain functions that calculate the sales tax and the total after tax. These functions should round the results to a maximum of two decimal places.
- Store the code that gets input and displays output in another module. Divide this code into functions wherever you think it would make that code easier to read and maintain.
- Assume the user will enter valid data.
