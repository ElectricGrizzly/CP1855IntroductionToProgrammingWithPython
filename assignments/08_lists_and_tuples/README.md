## Project 8-1: Prime Number Checker
Create a program that checks whether a number is a prime number and displays its factors if it is not a prime number.
### Console
```
Prime Number Checker

Please enter an integer between 1 and 5000: 5
5 is a prime number.

Try again? (y/n): y

Please enter an integer between 1 and 5000: 6
6 is NOT prime number.
It has 4 factors: 1 2 3 6

Try again? (y/n): y

Please enter an integer between 1 and 5000: 200
200 is NOT prime number.
It has 12 factors: 1 2 4 5 8 10 20 25 40 50 100 200

Try again? (y/n): n

```
### Specifications
- A prime number is divisible by two factors (1 and itself). For example, 7 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 7.
- If the user enters an integer thatâ€™s not between 1 and 5000, the program should display an error message.
- If the number is a prime number, the program should display a message.
- If the number is not a prime number, the program should display a message. Then, it should display the number of factors for the number and a list of those factors.
- Store the factors for each number in a list.
